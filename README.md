# Virtual_Photo_Studio
To run this project simply install the dependencies. The old project is inside test.py and new one consists 2 files. merged.py and test_test.py
Running test_test.py runs the project that is powered with BASNet(Boundary Aware Segmentation Bet)

Also you need to download the saved_model/basnet/basnet.pth from BASNet repo and run data_loader.py after that it should work as expected.
